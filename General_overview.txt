Following steps were followed in general
A. Preprocessing: 
    Resize all images to consistent size (256x256)
    Augmentation (+/- 30 degree, horizontal/vertical flip)
    Brightness and Contrast adjustment
    Segmentation of leaf (If background clutter exists, segmenting the leaf from the background isolates relevant features and improves model focus)
    Feature extraction
    EDA on training set
B. Selection of model --> CNN
C. Choosing Hyperparameters 
    Learning Rate: gradient descent, Typical starting values: 0.001 to 0.0001.
    Batch Size (Number of images processed before updating model weights: 16, 32, 64 depends on GPU memory)
    Number of Epochs 
    Optimizer: ADAM
    Dropout Rate (if used) Typical values: 0.2 to 0.5. 
    Weight Initialization and Regularization: Weight decay or L2 regularization helps reduce overfitting.: Common weight decay values: 0.0001 to 0.001.
D. Validation/testing (Accuracy, Precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrix)
